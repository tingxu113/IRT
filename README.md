***Motivation:*** Statistical analysis of low tensor tubal rank on seven HR-HSIs (the same color represents the same dataset). (a)–(f) Normalized tensor singular value curve of original HR-HSI and five permuted HR-HSIs, respectively.

***Visual Results:*** HSI-SR results of Indian Pines. The first and second rows present the results consisting of 11th, 48th, and 128th band of the fused images under
SNR = 15 dB and the corresponding error maps, respectively. The blue block shows the representation region.
