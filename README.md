***Motivation:*** Statistical analysis of low tensor tubal rank on seven HR-HSIs (the same color represents the same dataset). (a)–(f) Normalized tensor singular value curve of original HR-HSI and five permuted HR-HSIs, respectively.

***Overall Framework:*** The framework of our model. The details of our framework can be found in Sect. III.

***Fidelity:*** Fig. 4. (a) A close-up of the HRMS image of the Ple´iades dataset; (b)
Context-aware regions extracted from (a); (c) Scatter plot of ∇1X1 and ∇1P
for pixels belonging to Class 1 in (b); (d) A histogram of ∇1X1  ∇1P
for pixels belonging to Class 1 in (b). It is worth to be remarked that the
distribution of ∇1X1 and ∇1P is well described by a directly proportional
function, i.e., the black dotted line in (c). For other regions and bands, there is
a similar directly proportional relationship between HRMS and PAN images
in the gradient domain. Thus, the values of ∇X∇P are approximately the
same inside each region and for each band.

***Handling the decimation operation:*** Fig. 5. The graphic representation of (22) for a scale ratio equal to 4.
The white squares with a blank content indicate zero values. The first row
shows the processing from U to USST, which is equal to an element-wise
multiplication between DSST and U, i.e., the second row. It is worth noting
that DSST is produced from sparse matrices (i.e., the blue squares), whose
entries are 1 only in one position [44].

***Visual Results:*** Fig. 6. Fusion results with close-ups for the compared approaches on the four-band Ple´iades dataset at reduced resolution (size of the PAN image: 256 ×
256). . (a)-(j) Visual results in true colors of PRACS [9], RBDSD [49], C-GLP [59], GLP-Reg-FS [43], LGC [37], HQBP [60], PNN [19], TPNN [61], the
proposed method, and the ground-truth (GT), respectively. (k)-(t) Residual images for the displayed red band.
